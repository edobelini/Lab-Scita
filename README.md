<!-- ABOUT THE LAB -->
## About The Lab

The main focus of our team is 

* What are the molecular and physical mechanisms controlling tissue fluidification in epithelial cells and breast tumor models of DCIS?

* How the mechanical perturbations associated with unjamming by impacting the acquisition of heritable changes influence cell phenotypes, fate, and tumor ecology (tumor cell interaction with immune cells). We will specifically focus on unexpected cellular processes and molecular mechanisms underlying tissue fluidification-dependent genetic rewiring toward a cGAS-STING-mediated innate immunity response by studying the role of mitochondria dynamics, morphology, and integrity during unjamming-via-flocking.

* What are the pathobiological consequence of tissue fluidification by determining whether tissue fluidization can turn immunological cold lesions into hot ones using syngeneic mice models and human specimens.

My name is Andrea Disanza and I am a Cellular and Molecular Biologist. I earned my degree in Biological Sciences at “Università degli Studi di Milano” and my PhD in partnership with the Open University, London, UK, carrying out my research project at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO) and at IFOM ETS, Milan, Italy, under the supervision of Prof. Giorgio Scita and Prof. Pier Paolo di Fiore and at the LEBS, CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette, France under the supervision of Dr. Marie France Carlier. I completed my scientific training with a two years Post Doc. Since 2008 I hold the position of Staff Scientist in the laboratory of Prof. Giorgio Scita “Mechanism of tumor cell migration” and the position of Teaching Assistant in General Patology at “Università degli Studi di Milano”, Dipartimento Scienze della Saute, Milan, Italy. My research experience ranges across several subjects: molecular biology, cell biology and biochemistry, biochemistry and actin biochemistry, ex vivo and in vivo mouse models and microscopy (Wide Field/Confocal/TIRF). My studies are focused on the interplay between membrane and actin dynamics in the control of migratory and invasive strategies in cancer with an insight in the role of the I-BAR containing protein IRSp53.

Cell biologist by formation and a dreamer by nature, I grew up in Lebanon and ended up in Italy, after a long process of growth and maturation, first in France where I completed my PhD at the University of Nantes/Inserm Unit U913 then in Sweden at the Karolinska institute. Combining an extensive experience across several fields, I joined the laboratory of Prof. Giorgio Scita in 2020, converging my interest on molecular oncology. In particular, I am currently interested in studying the molecular and physical mechanisms controlling tissue fluidification in epithelial cells and the emergence of collective cell locomotion within solid tumors leading to the formation of metastasis.

 Brenda Green is a Biomedical Engineer and currently leading a project focused on developing micro-devices for capture of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from whole blood, and for characterization of biophysical properties of tumor clusters within the lab of Giorgio Scita. She has worked closely with device design, fluidics and correlating tumor cellular assays with relevant biological insight, as a part of international research teams at IFOM, the University of Toronto and ETH Zurich. These teams have intersected with oncologists at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori in Milan, and the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto to transition the technologies from laboratory to clinical research settings. At ETH Zurich, she demonstrated the advanced technological potential of a nano-printed system to track migration of cancer cells. Brenda obtained a bachelor degree in Chemical Engineering & Biochemistry from the University of Ottawa, a Master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Toronto and a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Toronto. She completed her post-doc training in the lab of Giorgio Scita from 2019-2022 focused on design and development of a microfluidic system to capture circulating tumor cell clusters.

During his Master's program, he joined the research team led by Giorgio Scita, exploring the role of RAB5A protein family members in collective motility within epithelial cell monolayers. Intrigued by the multidisciplinary approaches used in his lab, Leonardo chose to continue his academic journey under the mentorship of Giorgio Scita, pursuing a Ph.D. in Molecular Oncology at SEMM. Now in his fourth year, Leonardo's research focus is at the intersection of cell biology and biophysics. He is specifically investigating the complex role of mechanical heterogeneity in breast cancer invasion, utilising 2D and 3D in vitro models. Leonardo's expertise includes live cell imaging and image analysis, with a particular emphasis on characterising collective cell motility at a biophysical level.  </p>

Currently, I'm working on my 12 month internship thesis project at IFOM, under the supervision of Professor Giorgio Scita, aimed at discovering new parameters to be analyzed in a novel breast cancer’s mechano-classifier model based on machine learning, to predict the severity of the tumour. During this experience, I have been understanding the pure sense of biological and medical research, with an important focus on computational skills (Python and FIJI image analysis).  </p>

<!-- Pipelines -->
## Pipelines
In pipeline folder are present all our lab piplines in snakemake or nextflow. Within every folder are present:
* `.sk` or * `.nf` file, that contain all rules sequence. Usually for the standar pipelines the lab exploits the one in the <a href="https://nf-co.re/"> nf-core </a> repository. 
 ```bash
